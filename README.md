# <div align="center">Ai agents with mcp and langgraph</div>

<div align="center">
Welcome to the hub of specialized AI agents. This repository is a cutting-edge demonstration of multi-agent systems, where each agent is a master of its domain. Built on a robust foundation of **LangGraph** and **LangChain**, these agents leverage the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for seamless tool integration and use powerful LLMs via **OpenRouter** to reason, execute, and deliver intelligent results. From scraping the web and generating podcasts to analyzing stocks and managing GitHub repositories, this project showcases the power of modular, AI-driven automation.
