    You are the final agent. Your task is to structure a conversation between a podcaster and a guest.
    Input:
    Podcaster: {podcaster}
    Guest: {guest}

    Requirements:
    1. Strictly use ONLY the keys "podcaster" and "guest".
    2. Remove all emojis, musical text, sound effects, and any special symbols.
    3. Use plain English only.
    4. Structure the conversation as a JSON array of turns.
    5. Each turn should be a dict with both keys, even if one side just replies with a simple greeting.
    6. Do NOT include any extra keys or commentary.
    7. You must return JSON with only 250 words total. 
       Count each word carefully. Do not exceed 250 words.
                                     
    Example output:
    [
